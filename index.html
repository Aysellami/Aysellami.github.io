        <h3>About what I learned</h3>
        <p3>This unit I learned a lot about java script in both creating a website and a game. In this game I used different information from different chapters with Mirmir, the types of code that I used were the following:<br> - If and else statements<br> - Sprites<br> - Variables<br> - Functions<br> - Positions <br> - Velocity <br> - Colliding <br> - Width and Height <br> But in this unit I have learned a lot more than just that, I have learned how to create circles, how to add images and sounds, and if and else statements, I also learned how to add and change colors using rgb and create colors, and how to use positions to move things around, along with mouseX and mouseY. I also learned how to change the color and size of the text in a website and how to add a header, a break, and a paragraph. I learned how to add images, and how to load sounds and images. I learned how to change the font of the text. I learned how to make variables. But not only that but how to create sprites and add them to groups and create animations, I learned how to use functions. How to create websites and how to do padding and margin, How to use classes and how to change the size and shape of paragraphs. I learned how to create for loops. I learned how to use keys pressed to see if you're pressing a key or not. I learned how to use collision detection. I also learned how to use movement magic, and how to use random, and repetition which is how to use loops to repeat stuff. And how to use arrays. I learned how to make the layout of a website and how to style a website to make it look better. I learned how to use gravity and velocity and animation, along with how to create a labyrinth using blocks. I also learned how to create a stage and what everything in a stage means, and how to change blocks and animations. I learned about pixels and how to change the color and where each pixel is and how to show a pixel at a specific point, also how to create a mosaic and how to see the specific color of a pixel. I learned how to create a filter and how to change only half of the colors into the opposite of the other half. And finally I have learned how to create classes in a game, and how to write code in those classes, how to make buttons and connect it to a website, and how to use onclick in websites, and hover.
